    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study aims to explore the identification of gender in patients with heart disease, recognizing the biological differences between male and female patients that could affect the normal ranges of various predictors. Utilizing the K-nearest neighbors classification method, we intend to predict a patient's gender based on a subset of variables from the heart disease dataset. These variables include disease classification, cholesterol levels, resting electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and maximum heart rate achieved. While the heart disease dataset encompasses a broad range of variables, our analysis will focus exclusively on these selected predictors. There will also be 303 instances of data to be used for both training and testing our data\n",

    "From the results we can see that there is clearly a correlation as the accuracy is around 70 percent however in an article by Tapie et al.(2023) they found that gender only affects some heart health metrics in a meaningful way. This could explain our relatively low accuracy as our predictions assign some weight to statistics that cant realistically be used to determine gender and thus combines bad predictions into our results. With some scaling of the data to reflect its corelation to gender these results could likely be improved however that is outside the scope of our analysis of the topic.\n",

    "In conclusion we looked at the correlation between various heart metrics and gender in the data from the cleaveland area. We cound that there is some definitive correlation however our models accuracy was ~74 percent which indicates that there is significant room for improvements. Future studies could look at each individual metric seperately and determine if it should or should not be used to preodict geneder or look at different areas. Understanding the correlation between gender and heart metrics would help medical professionals give more personalized care and may even improve healthcare outcomes. Overall a better understanding of the heart and its average values is important and more work needs to be done to help improve the healthcare system."
