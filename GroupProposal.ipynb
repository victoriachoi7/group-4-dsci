    "Methods:\n",
    "We will take the data and clean it up before splitting it into two distinct groups with the following columns cholestoral, resting ECG, max heart rate, disease classification and gender. From here we will set up a K nearest neighbor analysis and attempt to predict gender based on the heart condition and the factors listed above. If we find no correlation than we will move on to using the same conditions to attempt to classify the disease. So that we have sufficient material to reflect on and draw conclusions from."
